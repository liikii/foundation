there are some text elements that are not intended to affect the 
structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the 
pages — they are known as semantic markup.

In the rest of the chapter you 
will meet some more elements 
that will help you when you are 
adding text to web pages. For 
example, you are going to meet 
the <em> element that allows 
you to indicate where emphasis 
should be placed on selected 
words and the <blockquote>
element which indicates that a 
block of text is a quotation.
Browsers often display the 
contents of these elements in 
a different way. For example, 
the content of the <em>
element is shown in italics, 
and a <blockquote> is usually 
indented. But you should not 
use them to change the way that 
your text looks; their purpose is 
to describe the content of your 
web pages more accurately.
The reason for using these 
elements is that other programs, 
such as screen readers or search 
engines, can use this extra 
information. For example, the 
voice of a screen reader may add 
emphasis to the words inside 
the <em> element, or a search 
engine might register that your 
page features a quote if you use 
the <blockquote> element



strong, em emphasis

the <q> element is used for 
shorter quotes that sit within 
a paragraph. Browsers are 
supposed to put quotes around 
the <q> element, however 
Internet Explorer does not — 
therefore many people avoid 
using the <q> element.
Both elements may use the cite
attribute to indicate where the 
quote is from. Its value should 
be a URL that will have more 
information about the source of 
the quotation

 HTML elements are used to describe the structure of 
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
X They also provide semantic information (e.g. where 
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any 
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

Links are the defining feature of the web 
because they allow you to move from 
one web page to another — enabling the 
very idea of browsing or surfing.
You will commonly come across the following types of links:
● Links from one website to another
● Links from one page to another on the same website
● Links from one part of a web page to another part of the 
same page
● Links that open in a new browser window
● Links that start up your email program and address a new 
email to someone
